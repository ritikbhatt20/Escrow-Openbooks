# OpenBooks Escrow Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

The proposed smart contract manages the process of book rentals, incorporating a variable pricing and duration model, an escrow mechanism for secure fund handling, and thorough documentation and API integration for usability.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Customizable Pricing

#### Implementation Strategy:

Define contract storage variable for `price_per_day`.

Provide setter and getter functions for adjusting the price, leveraging Rust's strong type system to ensure type safety.

Users can input a desired number of days, and the contract will dynamically calculate the total price (`total_price = price_per_day * number_of_days`).

### 2. Variable Rental Duration

#### Implementation Strategy:

Implement a struct to store rental details, including the duration in days and the datetime when the rental started.

Create functions to start and end rentals, using the blockchain timestamp to manage and verify the rental duration.

Allow modifications to the rental period, adjusting costs dynamically if changed before the rental starts.

### 3. Escrow Mechanism

#### Implementation Strategy:

Ensure that when a rental agreement is initiated, the funds (total rent price) from the renter are moved to an escrow account within the contract.

Hold funds in the escrow until the end of the rental period. Use smart contract conditions to ensure automatic release only if the rental term expires without disputes.

Include functions for conflict resolution where either party can raise disputes, to be handled according to predefined rules.

### 4. Security

#### Implementation Strategy:

Utilize Rustâ€™s features for memory safety and strong typing to minimize common vulnerabilities associated with smart contracts.

Implement ownership and permission checks to restrict sensitive actions to authorized users only.

Conduct thorough testing (unit and integration tests) using tools and frameworks compatible with Rust. Consider fuzzing for unexpected inputs handling.

Peer reviews and possibly a third-party audit to further ensure the contract's security.

### 5. Documentation

#### Implementation Strategy:

Write comprehensive and clear documentation using markdown for readability. This will cover:

- Deployment procedures.
- Method descriptions with parameters, expected outcomes, and potential errors.
- Examples of typical interactions with the contract.
- Maintenance guidelines.

## Deliverables

- **Smart Contract Code**: Written in Rust, well-commented, and adhering to best coding practices.
- **Testing Scripts**: For automated testing of the contract functionalities.
- **API Documentation and Code**: Using OpenAPI specifications for clarity and standardization.
- **User and Developer Documentation**: In markdown format, hosted on platforms like GitHub or ReadTheDocs.
